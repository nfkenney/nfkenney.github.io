						<h2>Cooking: Recipe reviews</h2>
						<p>My new year's resolution was to cook more as both a health-conscious and money-saving measure. As a result, I'm aggregating all the recipes I've tried, as well as what I thought about about each one (and pictures, if I took them).</p>

								<td>Day 1</td>
								<td>Pad Krapow Gai (Spicy Thai Basil Chicken)</td>
								<td>8/10</td>
								<td>Nice and spicy. Lots of flavor. Slightly overcooked the veggies, but they still tasted great.</td>
								<td>I didn't have soy sauce or oyster sauce, so I added <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sunnys-Gourmet-Products-Korean-Teriyaki/dp/B00ENWA5CE">Sunny's Korean Teriyaki Sauce</a> and extra fish sauce instead. Also added some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Huey-Fong-Sambal-Oelek-Chili/dp/B000JMAVXA"> Sambal Oelek</a> for extra spice as I couldn't find Thai chilis at Kroger.</td>

							<tr>
								<td>Day 2</td>
								<td>Pork Fried Rice</td>
								<td>7/10</td>
								<td>Good. Pork was flavorful and not too overcooked. Peas were a little overdone. Korean Teriyaki sauce went great in this recipe. Peas were almost burned but still somehow tasted really good?</td>
								<td>Didn't have soy sauce or fresh ginger, so I went with Korean Teriyaki and a bit less Sambal Oelek than yesterday and it worked here as well. Also didn't have broccoli</td>
								<td><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230818/pork-fried-rice/">Recipe</a> </td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Day 3</td>
								<td> One Pan Orecchiette Pasta</td>
								<td>2/10</td>
								<td>Really not great, and about half that was my fault. The pan I used was too small, which resulted in uneven pasta cooking, but pretty much all the flavor in the sauce is from low-sodium chicken stock, which is both too thin and too watery for a proper pasta sauce. </td>
								<td>Didn't have arugala or orecchiette (I used regular bowties instead), both of which which might help somewhat, but I wonder if the dish really gets much better than this.</td>
								<td><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239047/one-pan-orecchiette-pasta/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringId=15050&referringContentType=Recipe%20Hub&clickId=cardslot%2013">Recipe</a></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Day 4</td>
								<td>Golden Curry</td>
								<td>7/10</td>
								<td>This one isn't technically full cooking, as I did use a spice mix<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Curry-Sauce-Mix-Medium/dp/B0099IJBDQ/">(this one, to be specific)</a>, but it still involved enough cooking that I felt it counted. I chopped all ingredients, before crisping the vegetables and browning the chicken. I then followed the instructions on the curry pack (properly add 2 and a quarter cups of water and the sauce packet and stir until curry is properly mixed)</td> 
								<td>I made this with carrots, an onion, chicken thighs, and a potato.</td>

								<td>Day 4</td>
								<td>Long Day's Breakfast</td>
								<td>6/10</td>
								<td>This one stretches the limits of cooking as well, as it was just a simply egg scramble, but making food from scratch is making food from scratch, and so it counts. </td> 
								<td>This version of an egg scramble contained 3 eggs, sharp cheddar cheese, grilled onions (white and green), grilled mushrooms, and spicy Italian sausage.</td>
								<td>Recipe: Add everything but eggs to pan over medium heat. Sautee until golden brown. Add eggs to pan and scramble.</td>
